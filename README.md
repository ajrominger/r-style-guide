# R-language style guide

## Line length

No line of code or comment should be longer than 80 characters, *ever*

## Pipes

Don't use them.  If you want to break opperations over multiple lines, re-assign the ouput of each line.  It's a good idea to break opperations over multiple lines, nobody is saying to use nested functions instead of pipes.
